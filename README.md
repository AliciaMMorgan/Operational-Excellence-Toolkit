## Why This Repository Exists

Most PM toolkits share templates. Few share **operating patterns**—how teams think, decide, collaborate across constraints.

This space makes invisible dynamics visible, designs hybrid human+AI environments, shares portable practices.

**Fork. Adapt. Contribute.**

## 🧠 Working Environment Design

AI platforms have distinct strengths influencing adoption:

| Platform | Strength | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Claude | Strategic analysis, long-form reasoning | Complex planning |
| ChatGPT | Rapid synthesis, executive framing | Iteration |
| Perplexity | Research-backed exploration | External scanning |
| Gemini | Google Workspace collaboration | Teams |
| Copilot | Microsoft production workflows | Enterprise docs |

**Anchor to existing ecosystems** (Google for education, Microsoft for enterprise).
