# 🧭 Operational Excellence Toolkit

Cross-industry PM tools blending explicit (templates) with tacit (mindsets)—aviation regs to nonprofit agility. Prioritizes PMI value delivery: outcomes > effort/expenses. Medici Effect intersections spark execution.

## ✨ Quick Wins

- **Empathy Map**: Visual stakeholder alignment—tacit buy-in made explicit. (Blank template: upload empathy-map.md)
- **Risk Attitude Profiler**: 5-min team tolerance gauge (high/low risk sectors). (Add Excel quiz here)
- **Culture Map**: Bridge direct/indirect comms + decision styles. (Markdown table coming)

**Why Execution Matters**: Effectiveness (right outcomes) beats efficiency alone—leaders codify tacit knowledge for sustainable value, not just tactical delivery.
